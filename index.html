              <p>
                All paragraphs are wrapped in <code>p</code> tags. Additionally, <code>p</code> elements can be wrapped with a <code>blockquote</code> element <em>if the <code>p</code> element is indeed a quote</em>. Historically, <code>blockquote</code> has been used purely to force indents, but this is now achieved using CSS. Reserve <code>blockquote</code> for quotes.

              <p>
                The <code>hr</code> element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book. The following extract from Pandora’s Star by Peter F. Hamilton shows two paragraphs that precede a scene change and the paragraph that follows it:</p>

                    Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwearth could be appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <i>Maybe it won’t be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night’s shift.

                    The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow of Gralmond’s winters.

              <p>
                The <code>pre</code> element represents a block of pre-formatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements. Such examples are an e-mail (with paragraphs indicated by blank lines, lists indicated by lines prefixed with a bullet), fragments of computer code (with structure indicated according to the conventions of that language) or displaying <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> art. Here’s an example showing the printable characters of <abbr>ASCII</abbr>:

              <p>
                The <code>a</code> element is used to hyperlink text, be that to another page, a named fragment on the current page or any other location on the web. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                  <p><a href="/">Go to the home page</a> or <a href="#banner">return to the top of this page</a>.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>
                The <code>em</code> element is used to denote text with stressed emphasis, i.e., something you’d pronounce differently. Where italicizing is required for stylistic differentiation, the <code>i</code> element may be preferable. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p>You simply <em>must</em> try the negitoro maki!</p>

              <p>
                The <code>strong</code> element is used to denote text with strong importance. Where bolding is used for stylistic differentiation, the <code>b</code> element may be preferable. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p>

              <p>
                The <small>small</small> element is used to represent disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights (commonly referred to as ‘small print’). It can also be used for attributions or satisfying licensing requirements. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">

              <p>
                The <code>s</code> element is used to represent content that is no longer accurate or relevant. When indicating document edits i.e., marking a span of text as having been removed from a document, use the <code>del</code> element instead. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p><s>Recommended retail price: £3.99 per bottle</s><br><strong>Now selling for just £2.99 a bottle!</strong></p>

              </h3>
              <p>
                The <code>cite</code> element is used to represent the title of a work (e.g. a book, essay, poem, song, film, TV show, sculpture, painting, musical, exhibition, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing. Example:

                The <code>dfn</code> element is used to highlight the first use of a term. The <code>title</code> attribute can be used to describe the term. Example:

              </h3>
              <p>
                The <code>abbr</code> element is used for any abbreviated text, whether it be acronym, initialism, or otherwise. Generally, it’s less work and useful (enough) to mark up only the first occurrence of any particular abbreviation on a page, and ignore the rest. Any text in the <code>title</code> attribute will appear when the user’s mouse hovers the abbreviation (although notably, this does not work in Internet Explorer for Windows). Example abbreviations:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p><abbr title="British Broadcasting Corportation">BBC</abbr>, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, and <abbr title="Staffordshire">Staffs.</abbr></p>

                The <code>time</code> element is used to represent either a time on a 24 hour clock, or a precise date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, optionally with a time and a time-zone offset. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p>Queen Elizabeth II was proclaimed sovereign of each of the Commonwealth realms on <time datetime="1952-02-6">6</time> and <time datetime="1952-02-7">7 February 1952</time>, after the death of her father, King George VI.</p>

              <p>
                The <code>var</code> element is used to denote a variable in a mathematical expression or programming context, but can also be used to indicate a placeholder where the contents should be replaced with your own value. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">

              <div class="example">

                The <code>kbd</code> element is used to denote user input (typically via a keyboard, although it may also be used to represent other input methods, such as voice commands). Example:

              <div class="example">

              <p>
                The <code>sup</code> element represents a superscript and the sub element represents a <code>sub</code>. These elements must be used only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical presentation. As a guide, only use these elements if their absence would change the meaning of the content. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p>
                  The coordinate of the <var>i</var>th point is (<var>x<sub><var>i</var></sub></var>, <var>y<sub><var>i</var></sub></var>). For example, the 10th point has coordinate (<var>x<sub>10</sub></var>, <var>y<sub>10</sub></var>).

              <p>
                The <code>i</code> element is used for text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose. Examples include taxonomic designations, technical terms, idiomatic phrases from another language, the name of a ship or other spans of text whose typographic presentation is typically italicised. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p>

                The <code>b</code> element is used for text stylistically offset from normal prose without conveying extra importance, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typographic presentation is typically emboldened. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p>You enter a small room. Your <b>sword</b> glows brighter. A <b>rat</b> scurries past the corner wall.</p>
              </div>

              <h3 class="Heading Heading--large">

              </h3>
              <p>
                The <code>mark</code> element is used to represent a run of text marked or highlighted for reference purposes. When used in a quotation it indicates a highlight not originally present but added to bring the reader’s attention to that part of the text. When used in the main prose of a document, it indicates a part of the document that has been highlighted due to its relevance to the user’s current activity. Example:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p>I also have some <mark>kitten</mark>s who are visiting me these days. They’re really cute. I think they like my garden! Maybe I should adopt a <mark>kitten</mark>.</p>

              <p>
                The <code>del</code> element is used to represent deleted or retracted text which still must remain on the page for some reason. Meanwhile its counterpart, the <code>ins</code> element, is used to represent inserted text. Both <code>del</code> and <code>ins</code> have a <code>datetime</code> attribute which allows you to include a timestamp directly in the element. Example inserted text and usage:
              </p>
              <div class="example">
                <p>
                  She bought <del datetime="2005-05-30T13:00:00">two</del> <ins datetime="2005-05-30T13:00:00">five</ins> pairs of shoes.

                <h3>Ordered list</h3>
                <p>
                  The ol element denotes an ordered list, and various numbering schemes are available through the CSS (including 1,2,3… a,b,c… i,ii,iii… and so on). Each item requires a surrounding &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt; tag, to denote individual items within the list (as you may have guessed, li stands for list item).
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
                  <li>
                    This is the second item, which contains a sub list
                    <ol>
                      <li>This is the sub list, which is also ordered.</li>
                      <li>It has two items.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>This is the final item on this list.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Unordered list</h3>
                <p>
                  The ul element denotes an unordered list (ie. a list of loose items that don’t require numbering, or a bulleted list). Again, each item requires a surrounding &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt; tag, to denote individual items. Here is an example list showing the constituent parts of the British Isles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                      United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:
                      <ul>
                          <li>England</li>
                          <li>Scotland</li>
                          <li>Wales</li>
                          <li>Northern Ireland</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Republic of Ireland</li>
                  <li>Isle of Man</li>
                  <li>
                      Channel Islands:
                      <ul>
                          <li>Bailiwick of Guernsey</li>
                          <li>Bailiwick of Jersey</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Definition list</h3>
              <p>
                The dl element is for another type of list called a definition list. Instead of list items, the content of a dl consists of dt (Definition Term) and dd (Definition description) pairs. Though it may be called a “definition list”, dl can apply to other scenarios where a parent/child relationship is applicable. For example, it may be used for marking up dialogues, with each dt naming a speaker, and each dd containing his or her words.
              </p>
              <dl>
                <dt>This is a term.</dt>
                <dd>This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.</dd>
                <dt>Here is another term.</dt>
                <dd>And it gets a definition too, which is this line.</dd>
                <dt>Here is term that shares a definition with the term below.</dt>
                <dt>Here is a defined term.</dt>
                <dd><code>dt</code> terms may stand on their own without an accompanying <code>dd</code>, but in that case they <em>share</em> descriptions with the next available <code>dt</code>. You may not have a <code>dd</code> without a parent <code>dt</code>.</dd>
              </dl>
